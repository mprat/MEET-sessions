      "1. In the previous exercise you had the variable `square = pygame.Surface([20, 20])` that creates a box on the screen. Instead of doing this with an instance of the `Surface` class, we want to do this with a custom class of ours. In the `pygame_example.py` file, above the main method but below the `import pygame` statement, create a new class that subclasses the pygame Surface class. The class header should look like this: \n",
      "```\n",
      "class MySurface(pygame.Surface):\n",
      "    ....\n",
      "```\n",

      "2. Your custom surface class should store it's own color in a variable.\n",
      "3. Change the `square` from the original main code to use your own custom `MySurface` class.\n",
      "4. Test to make sure it works, and when you are done, call an instructor / TA over for a demo"
